# OopsI0wnedItAgain ðŸ”¥

A mildly unstable red team playbook for when you need a foothold, but also a laugh.

## ðŸ“¦ What's Inside

Full-scope pentest framework with organized folders and checklists for every phase, plus a script to auto-deploy project scaffolds.

## ðŸ’» Pentest Project Launcher

Use `scripts/init_pentest_project.py` to generate a local pentest project with:
- Phase folders
- Markdown checklists
- Loot, screenshots, and artifacts directories
- Auto-generated `.gitignore` for safety

```bash
python3 scripts/init_pentest_project.py
```

âœ… Use this to create `/projects/engagement-name/` locally â€” safely outside Git tracking.

## ðŸš¨ Use Responsibly

> "Oops... I scanned it again." â€” You, probably.
