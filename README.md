# OopsI0wnedItAgain 🔥

A mildly unstable red team playbook for when you need a foothold, but also a laugh.

## 💥 What’s Inside

This repo is a full-phase penetration testing framework — checklists, tool sets, and tactical notes across all the juicy phases:

- 🔍 Scoping & Planning
- 🕵️ Recon (passive + active)
- 📡 Enumeration
- 🎯 Exploitation
- 🧠 Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement
- 📓 Reporting (a.k.a. The Cover Your Ass Phase)

## ⚙️ Who's It For?

- Red teamers with chaos in their heart ❤️
- Pentesters who document (begrudgingly)
- Homelab hackers trying to level up
- People who like root and bad puns

## 🚨 Use Responsibly

All scripts, checklists, and tools are for authorized testing environments only. Unless you want to hear from Britney *and* legal.
